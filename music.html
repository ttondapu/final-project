        <h1>My Music</h1>
        <p>Something you may not know about me is that I am very interested in music and production.</p>
        <p>I was trained in classical piano outside of school, and played the flute in the school jazz band until high school.</p>
            <img class = "square" src = "images/piano.jpg" alt = "headshot">
        <p>After years of concerts and regional/state showcases, I decided to venture into composition and production. I started by making acoustic covers of popular songs, and soon I learned to use software such as FL Studio, a digital audio workstation.</p>
        <p>Focusing mostly on trap and RnB styles, I work with artists to provide them with instrumentals. Here's a video of me at the studio in Philadelphia, where a friend is recording over a beat I produced.</p>
